# Direction of `pdappend`

`pdappend` is for developers, analysts, or even less formal users. It should be easy to use and fun to build. Making currently implemented features more robust is prioritized. Adding terminal goodies is next in line. The code will be iteratively refactored over time. The codebase should be consise and very explicit.
